Tower of Hanoi
This was a homework assignment from my C++ class.

For this assignment there are three towers A,B, and C. As well as 'n' rings to be entered by the user. All rings start in Tower A and must be moved from Tower A to Tower B. At no point can a ring with a greater number can be placed on top of a smaller numbered ring. Record all necessary steps needed to do this.
